# Project-1
Repository for CineMatic, the Automatic Film Search Engine. With CineMatic you will be able to search movie titles using the iMDB and OMDB API's. Your search will query the search results into an easy to read platform. From your results, you can click to see more info for any of the titles. The additional details include The Casting, Directors, Genre, Plot, and the Ratings from IMDB, OMDB, and RottenTomatoes, and a functional Youtube trailer.
